-- Task 1 Steps --
-- Please try to solve the task first without using this file as a guidance --

1)- You need to create a new repository for your task, and in order to do that you will need a platform for Git, either Github or Gitlab.
2)- Create an account on either of the platforms mentioned then create your new remote repository, just follow the steps its simple.
3)- Now in order to work locally you need to clone your repository on your machine therefore you have two options:
    - HTTPS clone: you just use the command git clone <web_url_copied_from_your_platform>
	- SSH clone: you use the same command git clone <ssh_url> but make sure first that you create a new SSH key on your local machine
	& add it to your Github/Gitlab account so that the clone works
	
4)- You will need to install Git to work on your local machine which can be done from this link: https://git-scm.com/ You have the choice to use
Git Bash which is what I recommend to get familiar with Git commands or any other software/tool (ex. TortoiseGit)

Note: you could have started by creating a local repository first then linking it to a remote repository on the platform but the previous
approach is highly recommended.

A Code snippet is provided below but instead of using cloning, we initialized the local repository then linked it to the remote repository we created:

# Create project directory
mkdir my-project
cd my-project

# Initialize git
git init

# Add your files
echo "# My Project" > README.md

# Connect to remote
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
git push -u origin main
